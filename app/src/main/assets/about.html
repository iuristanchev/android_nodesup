<P>Using the tool is pretty simple you just input the ips/dns names that you want to ping/rdns/get mx and click refresh/check.
<P>Failed pings will have OFF on the toggle buttons. Succeeded pings will have ON. Results may vary depending on your ISP and carrier if you use it trough 3G network.
<P>Also you have one field where you can test a service with port.
<P> Have fun!
